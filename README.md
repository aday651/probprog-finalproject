# Final Project Repository

## Summary of project

[I'll give a summary of the project at a later date.]

## Description of data 

In lieu of a fuller description of the data (which I'll provide soon), there is 
a description available on the [SNAP website](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-otc.html), 
and the data used for the project (including the ground truth labels) can be 
found at the following [webpage](https://cs.stanford.edu/%7Esrijan/rev2/).
